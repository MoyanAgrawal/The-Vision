            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Positive psychology began as a new domain of psychology in 1998 when
                Martin Seligman chose it as the theme for his term as president of the American Psychological
                Association. It is a reaction against past practices, which have tended to focus on mental
                illness and emphasized maladaptive behavior and negative thinking. It builds on the humanistic movement
                by Abraham Maslow, Rollo May, James Bugental, and Carl Rogers, which encourages an emphasis on
                happiness, well-being, and positivity, thus creating the foundation for what is now known as positive
                psychology.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">The Positivity is here.</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Positive psychologists have suggested a number of factors may contribute
                to happiness and subjective well-being. For example, social ties with a spouse, family, friends,
                colleagues, and wider networks; membership in clubs or social organizations; physical exercise; and the
                practice of meditation. Spirituality can also be considered a factor that leads to increased
                individual happiness and well-being. Spiritual practice and religious commitment is a topic researchers
                have been studying as another possible source for increased well-being and an added part of positive
                psychology. Happiness may rise with increasing financial income, though it may plateau or even fall
                when no further gains are made or after a certain cut-off amount.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">The End of Negativity.</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Positive psychology is concerned with eudaimonia, a Greek word meaning
                "good spirit". It is considered an essential element for the pursuit of happiness and a good life.
                It emphasizes cherishing that which holds the greatest value in life and other such factors that
                contribute the most to having a good life. While not attempting a strict definition of what makes up a
                good life, positive psychologists agree that one must be happy, engaged, and meaningful with their
                experiences. Martin Seligman referred to "the good life" as using your signature strengths every day to
                produce authentic happiness and abundant gratification.</p>
